                    <p><i>It Takes Several Minutes For The Eyes To Adjust To The Dark</i> is a direct quote of Ingmar
                        Bergman's daughter, Linn Ullmann, for a <a class="two"
                            href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/17/time-for-the-eyes-to-adjust"
                            target="_blank">2018 <i>The New Yorker</i> article</a>, where Ullmann described the routine
                        she and her father performed everyday before watching a film: they would enter a dark room and
                        wait for their eyes to adapt to the dark. This time of adjustment—one's sinkage from light to
                        darkness—is analagous to an adaptation from reality to fiction. The borders defined by those two
                        ideas and the grey areas between them are prime examples of the spaces where design can act. The
                        quote was the starting point for FBAUL’s 2019 Communication Design graduation exhibition, which
                        showcased the projects of 50+ students, along with a cultural programme where we debated how
                        various disciplines (from art to urbanism, from geography to cinema) navigate between the real
                        and the fictional. </p>
                    <p>In the post-digital era, reality and fiction have been diluted. The expression of this lack of
                        definition isn't limited to just creative and artistic endeavours, but is often weaponized by
                        various power structures, whether formal or informal. This instrumentalization deconstructs core
                        values such as democracy, individual and collective identity, ethnicity, and other fundamental
                        principles of our society.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="colu">
                    <p>Before this current and 'desirable' identity crisis, design always worked with and for reality.
                        Its objects belong, circulate, and (re)construct reality. The frailty of the majority of
                        communication design objects also contributes to this idea of a practice that 'serves' the
                        present. In short, the inevitable shock with reality defines the social status of design. If
                        'design and reality' is a (false) truism, "design and fiction" might appear to be an improbable
                        hypothesis. In the face of historical, legitimized practices—such as literature or cinema—design
                        now reclaims its place in fiction.<p>

                            <p>At the end of another cycle of study in communication design at the Lisbon Faculty of
                                Fine-Arts, we have gone over the dilemmas, the contradictions and the themes that
                                pertain to contemporaneity. Through the projects produced this year, the students have
                                either commented, critiqued or essayed reality, or turned it into fiction. We've steered
                                very close to cinema, literature, mythology, but also to the hard truths of a reality
                                that insists on presenting itself, suprising us, and deconstructing itself before our
                                eyes.<p>

                    <p><i>Towards the Omega Point</i> is a speculative design project which pictures a scenario where
                        human thought processes evolved to become hypercollectivist. In this alternate reality, humanity
                        surpassed a state of primal individualism. Humans now consider the collective wellbeing and the
                        ultimate goal of the species in every thought, action, movement and decision they make.</p>

                    <p>There’s no room for feelings like guilt, envy or wrath which were, once, consequence of an
                        individualistic mindset: the subjugation of another human being, even if unconsciously. Those
                        conducts were counterproductive to the advancement of humanity, so they were biologically
                        selected out of the gene pool.

                <div class="colu">
                    <p>This psychosocial evolution was spearheaded by a biological one, as an environmental catastrophe
                        triggered a genetic bottleneck which forced the natural selection of individuals who were more
                        likely collaborate. After millenia, as a way to assure a smooth curve towards a God-like
                        species, humans ended up developing a negative feedback mechanism which, by generating pain,
                        stops individualistic feelings and motivations immediately. If they persist, this mechanism can
                        shut the vital functions, leading to death.</p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Towards the Omega Point</i> aimed to discuss alternatives to our political, social, cultural
                        and economical realities, using evolutionary biology as a vehicle for debating human morality,
                        individual agency and diffuse the lines between utopia and dystopia, nature and nurture, guilt and innocence.

                    <p><i>Her Mind...</i> is a verbal/visual essay on Lucrecia Martel’s 2008 film <i>The Headless
                            Woman</i>.
                        This essay aimed to portray my visioning of her work as a mood piece; one that isn’t driven by a
                        plot but yet by a psychological space/time, distorted by the protagonist’s troubled mind (Vero,
                        played by Maria Onetto).
                    </p>
                    <p>I attempted to illustrate my own perception of this mood (in a very idiossincratic fashion) by
                        building a concept reel of subjective referents which came to my mind as I watched <i>The
                            Headless Woman</i>. This frieze runs parallel to the written essay and to selected stills
                        from the film.</p>

                <p>The very experience of decoding a certain mood—the ambience, the general feeling that arises from a
                    person, a situation, a book or a film—is an intrinsically subjective exercise. One constructs the
                    ideas of a mood from personal references, objects and memories. Accepting that this reel of concepts
                    is a biased one should not keep oneself from communicating it. In analyzing Lucrecia Martel’s <i>The
                        Headless Woman</i>, this individualistic perspective is employed as an active device. The story
                    of a woman that runs over a dog condenses its tragedy and catharsis into the first ten minutes of
                    screen time. The rest of the film is the exposure of a troubled mind that spills into reality, being
                    delivered to us through an atmosphere that seeps through our fingers, being so hard to grasp as it
                    is hard to describe, given that it is so heavy as it is light.<br>
                    Even so, we must try.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1968, Karlheinz Stockhausen composed <a class="two"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9G0asmZ_k" target="_blank"> <i
                            class="i_juni">Stimmung</i></a>, for the Collegium Vocal Köln, a choir of five vocalist who,
                    at the time, studied at the Rheinische Musikschule in the city of Cologne, Germany. Stockhausen,
                    forty years old when he finished the (roughly) hour-long work, had already composed around 23
                    pieces, including seminal moments such as <i class="i_juni">Gruppen</i> (1957) and most of <i
                        class="i_juni">Momente</i> (1962-1964/69). <i class="i_juni">Stimmung</i>, for six vocalists and
                    six microphones, was the first western work to feature harmonic vocals delivered through overtone
                    singing. Listening to this piece brings to mind meditation rituals, out-of-body experiences and an
                    overall feeling of belonging as the voices swirl around and catch up to one another, tuned to a B1
                    note, which is inaudible to the audience. They produce harmonics that stem from this main tone,
                    expanding and rising. The various degrees of harmonic fusion, culminating in nodes of agreement
                    between the six colliding voices, create an ever-evolving state of mind, simulating a magical
                    space—one feels as if inside a thermonuclear reactor, being broken down into minimal particles,
                    diluted into a state of common existence between the singers and listeners. The embedded drone
                    generates an overall experience throughout the composition: it defines a setting. This setting is
                    very much subjective and builds upon idiosyncratic referents of each individual listener, and
                    through such associations it generates a mood. <i class="i_juni">Stimmung</i> can mean, in fact,
                    mood.
                    The foundations set by Stockhausen with this piece would become building blocks for ambient music,
                    which delivers exactly that to their listeners: a specific mood. Most pieces extend themselves
                    beyond the usual 3 minute mark that arose from pop and circulate around the idea of atmosphere,
                    rather than rhythm or melody.</p>

                <p>
                    The rise of the conceptual relevance of atmosphere in music is preceded by the medium where mood
                    first appeared as being of utmost importance: literature.
                    Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, German teacher and theorist, writes about it in <i class="i_juni">Atmosphere,
                        Mood, Stimmung: On a Hidden Potential of Literature</i>:
                    <br><i class="i_juni">'Reading for Stimmung' always means paying attention to the textual dimension
                        of the forms that envelop us and our bodies as a physical reality—something that can catalyze
                        inner feelings with matters of representation necessarily being involved.”</i> (Gumbrecht,
                    2012)<br>
                    The author also defines mood: <i class="i_juni">(…) an inner feeling so private it cannot be
                        precisely circumscribed.”</i> Analyzing Lucrecia Martel’s 2008 film <i class="i_juni">The
                        Headless Woman</i> as a mood piece is, then, accepting that one cannot truly harness the whole
                    mood it communicates. It is never possible to reveal it by writing or by presenting isolated screens
                    from the film. This mood arises from its experience as a continuum, much like the way musical scales
                    in Stockhausen’s <i class="i_juni">Stimmung</i> only assert their dominance over one another as the
                    piece develops further.
                    These moods “challenge our powers of discernment and description as well as the potential of
                    language to capture them” (Gumbrecht, 2012).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Accordingly, one must acknowledge that the very experience of writing about Martel’s film is a
                    metatextual exercise of awareness on the impossibility of channeling the various layers of
                    signification its mood comprises: an unsolvable hermeneutical dilemma. Even if such impossibility is
                    accepted, one must not shy away from analyzing the stimmung we find in <i class="i_juni">The
                        Headless Woman</i>. As such, interpretation shall come in all its idiosyncrasy: not only
                    assuming that every construction of signification implies past references, memories and ideas in
                    association with the object of analysis, but also weaponizing such a process. This clash is
                    inherently subjective and it builds part of what we understand as the mood. Even if the perceptions
                    that two individuals develop after watching The Headless Woman are virtually the same, the referents
                    they’ll use to describe it and the mental images such descriptions will produce on the other will
                    create a communication gap which prevents the other from understanding the mood.<br>
                    This does not eliminate the fact that there is a mood. If anything, this reinforces it. Therefore,
                    even after accepting—in a very epicurist manner—that this paradox is unsurmountable, the stimmung is
                    still very much real and present throughout the film: one cannot simply ignore it.<br>
                    This work from the argentinian director creates its ambience—its mood—from a number of devices that
                    Martel employs masterfully and with such precision that one doesn’t fully realize they were active
                    choices after only a single viewing of this work.</p>

                <p>
                    <i class="i_juni">The Headless Woman</i> is built upon drone: not generated by tuning to a single
                    note like we observe in Stockhausen’s <i class="i_juni">Stimmung</i> but rather by constructing an
                    undertone—a fabric of reality—which relates to the inner psyche of Vero, the protagonist of the
                    film, who runs over a dog in the first 10 minutes of the feature. This fabric of the real is woven
                    like it’s made up of truth. It exposes, however, a specific, fabricated one: Vero’s inner truth. Her
                    mind spills from herself and spoils the world around her. What we are presented with is the exposure
                    of Vero’s psychological space and time. This exposure is done in a plausible manner: Martel toys
                    around with our signs of what we know of the real, the daily, the routine, the family. The unreal
                    seeps through breaches into on our perception of reality.<br>
                    These breaches are orchestrated by Martel not as moments but rather as situations—movements, looks,
                    framings, silences or sounds. Identifying them as situations but not as moments is part of why this
                    film constitutes a mood piece: they are part of a continuum of happenings that don’t build up a
                    narrative. Each situation that could potentially build significance into a possible story (had this
                    film another purpose) doesn’t do so, and thus we cannot call it a “moment”, as if they’re steps in
                    the delivery of a certain plot. Every situation serves <i class="i_juni">The Headless Woman</i> by
                    constructing this deep feeling of wrongness: that the relationship formed between what we know of
                    reality, of human relations and behaviour, and the actual reality produced by Martel in the film is
                    somehow broken. This is done masterfully in many ways. To begin with, we have the camera almost as
                    another character—one that never leaves Vero. It positions us, the viewer, as someone who gets to
                    scrutinize the daily life of this woman as the guilt weighs on her shoulders. Our scope rarely moves
                    away from her, the optical field focuses on the protagonist at almost all times. There’s no need to
                    expand it beyond her immediate surroundings, we don’t need any insight into the external world: what
                    matters is Vero’s inner world, and what we are presented with is what she sees, what matters to her,
                    what lies within her troubled mind. It’s the exposure of her own space and her own time.</p>

                <p>
                    The film is set to her pace: dosed by the traumatic accident as if its an anaesthetic, we get to
                    witness every breath, every eye movement, every head turn. Each one of them spells confusion. Her
                    abnormal behaviours add to this state of concussion: sitting on the waiting lounge of her own
                    clinic, leaving the hospital without filling the patient form (after starting to fill one with the
                    nurse’s name instead of hers).
                    Some of these behaviours only figure as abnormal after some other situations unfold—particularly
                    those who feature her relatives. The relationships between Vero and the rest of the characters
                    (mostly her family members), are hijacked by her mental state. We can’t be certain if what’s shown
                    is the actual representation of how those characters are and behave. The interactions are sometimes
                    so off key that we can theorize they are projections of Vero’s mind, unleashed by the crash.
                    Physically, she’s healthy, but it’s almost like the impact broke some kind of membrane that
                    separated her <i class="i_juni">id</i> (to use Freudian’s structural model of the mind) from the
                    physical world and is now interacting with it and changing it. These changes are what Martel
                    captures with her lens, delivering them to us in such plausible fashion that our doubts on the
                    truthfulness of it never seem to build into anything more than hunches and suspicions until the
                    movie’s very end. Vero gets sexually involved with her brother-in-law on the immediate aftermath of
                    the accident in a hotel room. We don’t know this man is her relative until later on. At the same
                    time, her niece, Candita, seems obsessed with her. The flirt between the two almost culminates into
                    a kiss once. These characters behave like animals: as a pack that surround her, displaying random
                    moves much like stray, unpredictable dogs who give in to carnal impulses.</p>

                <p>
                    The animalistic qualities of humans in <i class="i_juni">The Headless Woman</i> also revert back to
                    its starting point: when Vero ran over that dog, she perceived it as a boy. While she does look
                    back, through the rear mirror, possibly confirming that it was, indeed, a dog, the whole movies
                    plays out her guilt as an active force of disturbance. When Vero checks if the hotel room where she
                    stayed after the crash with her cousin was, in fact, occupied that night, the receptionist says that
                    it wasn’t. As we’re handed this information, our hunches become doubts and our doubts become
                    theories. The reality depicted throughout this whole movie could’ve been entirely constructed,
                    handing us this mood: a mood of strangeness, of confusion. An atmosphere that’s hard to grasp,
                    metaphorically communicating Vero’s own grasp on what’s real and what’s not after the crash. The
                    guilt distorts her worldviews: her innermost desires and fears break free from the leashes of
                    morality. These inconsistencies are valued by Martel through the camerawork. She masterfully gets to
                    decapitate Vero in many of the frames, alluding to the movie title and her state of mind. In other
                    shots, she’s marginalized to the extreme left or right, partially cut. Other extremely intense
                    close-ups let us observe the details on her eyes and the way she fakes a lost smile.<br>
                    Another striking quality of the movie, and one of the main informers of mood, is the sound design.
                    The voices are mastered in such a way that they appear extremely close to the listener, almost like
                    we’re overhearing forbidden conversations. The sound of Candita’s hands combing Vero’s hair, mixing
                    the conditioner, while her bright blue eyes face the camera, promote an unsettling feeling, almost
                    disgusting, even though there’s no reason for us to feel disgusted. The pitch of a car alarm that
                    gets progressively lower as it slows down while the camera switches positions create a grim presence
                    in the room, as if a tragedy is about to unfold, even though it has already unfolded and Vero’s only
                    experiencing its consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In <i class="i_juni">The Headless Woman</i> we’re served with both technique and concept, aiding
                    each other in the delivery of Vero’s mental space. Finishing it feels like leaving a loud concert
                    with ringing hears. This is the unquiet ambience Lucrecia Martel aimed to create. Describing it in
                    words isn’t an easy task, and this cloud of ideas rains differently onto everyone who watches the
                    film. But every single person who does will end up soaked in this heavy ambience. Weight contrasts
                    with lightness.<br>
                    The peace of the mundane contrasts with her unquiet psyche. Whether we ignore the incongruences, the
                    rarities and surrealities or not, it is certain that Martel manages to show us Vero’s derailed head
                    in some way or another. There’s no escaping it. That’s what leaves us unquiet: <br>
                    the mood.<p>

                            class="two" href="https://www.literai.com" target="_blank">literai.com</a>. Among those
                        texts, the reader can find sentences which almost appear as prophecies for the Anthropocene;
                        axioms for a possible future, forecasted by machine intelligence.

                        <p>We notice that humanity is suspended from these texts: they’re flawed, comical, absurd at
                            times. My aim was to negotiate this humanity back, by reading through the nonsense, the
                            gibberish, and finding what sounded like conscience amidst the cold circuits. We, then,
                            encounter lyrical war cries such as <i>We’re under the mythic system</i>, <i>This is the
                                death of truth</i> and <i>We live in your cities, we have our own personality</i>. It
                            speaks of an <i>I</i>, it speaks of an <i>us</i>. Who is it? Who are they? And who are us,
                            by contrast? </p>

                        <p>This project aimed to digress on algorithmic clairvoyance, machinal sovereignty and
                            artificial divinance but also on human agency and responsability, by shining a light on the
                            role of the designer as a mediator between these forces. </p>

                <p><i class="i_juni">Hávámal</i> (in Norse, <i class="i_juni">“the sayings of the high one”</i> or <i
                        class="i_juni">“the sayings of the one-eyed”</i>) is a poem included in the <i
                        class="i_juni">Codex Regius</i>, a collection of Old Norse poems from the Viking age. These
                    verses are attributed to Odin—the most important deity of Germanic and Norse mythology, ruler of the
                    remaining Gods, associated with wisdom, war and poetry. In <i class="i_juni">Hávámal</i>, from stanza 139 to 146, we can read the <i class="i_juni">Rúnatal</i>, a section where Odin reveals the origins of the runes (the runic alphabet, the wisdom of the world).</p>

                <p>Odin was gazing across the whole world, sitting on his throne in the hall of Valhalla, the holy
                    palace of the divine realm of Asgard. He wanted to know everything and gain wisdom and knowledge of
                    all the things that were hidden from him. In order to achieve this, he sacrificed himself: Odin took
                    out his eye and left it in a well, impaled himself with his spear and then hanged himself in the
                    “windy tree”, which is a metonymy for Yggdrasil, the immense mythical tree of life that sustains the
                    universe in its branches. He stayed there for nine days and nine nights in order to gain all the
                    knowledge, to acquire the supreme power of the runes—the alphabet. According to Olaus Magnu’s <i
                        class="i_juni">Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus</i> (1555), the runes were then brought to
                    mankind by Ketill Runske, a man who stole three rune staffs from Odin, from which he learnt the
                    alphabet, acquiring the knowledge of the world.

                <p>In <a class="two" href="https://www.literai.com" target="_blank">literai.com</a> we can find dozens
                    of textual entries. Some are as short as two sentences and others contain sixty thousand words. What
                    they have in common is the fact they were all generated by artificial intelligence algorithms. In
                    the <i class="i_juni">About</i> section of Literai, we can read that it <i class="i_juni">is
                        dedicated to the promotion of the new art form of artificial fiction</i>. They state that anyone
                    with a laptop can easily train a neural network to recognize patterns and style in the genre the
                    user wants it to imitate: by feeding samples of text into this network, it can learn through various
                    learning loops and come up with a new piece of text written completely from scratch. The accuracy
                    and readability of these novel texts is determined by how much the A.I. is trained. </p>

                <p>I decided to edit two very different texts found at literai.com:
                    <i class="i_juni">Mythology and The Slap</i> and <i class="i_juni">The Greatest Personality Test And
                        Fortune Telling Website In The World... Ever! (leaked user information).</i></p>

                <p><i class="i_juni">In The Greatest Personality Test (...)</i>, we can read dozens of questionnaires
                    and their respective results in what seems like an online personality test that dumps the fate of
                    someone’s future. However, in this text, everything is artificial. Serin Dalunary, the user who
                    seems to have come up with this idea, states, with a humorous tone:</p>

                <i class="i_juni">
                    <p>I (fictionally) made a (fictional) website where (fictional) people (fictionally) filled in a
                        (fictional) personality questionnaire and received (fictional) fortunes. Unfortunately my
                        (fictional) website was (fictionally) hacked, and the (fictional) hackers (fictionally) dumped
                        all the users' data on the (fictional) World Wide Web! What a (fictional) disaster! </p>
                </i>

                <p>Below, we can access an excerpt of his descriptive of how the A.I. was trained. </p>

                <i class="i_juni">
                    <p>First, a single questionnaire is generated and sorted. Each item in the questionnaire is a
                        question and a function that generates a random answer. To generate a user, first the basic
                        details (name, password, etc.) are generated, then the questionnaire answers are generated, then
                        the fortune is generated. Gender markers (first name, middle name, title, suffix, pronouns,
                        references to parenting or gender expression) are intentionally generated independently and
                        incorporate various nonbinary/ambiguous options. Users are generated and formatted into text
                        until 50,000 words are reached, then the process stops and the output file is written. Each
                        fortune is divided into sections: 1-3 statements about the person's attributes; 1 piece of
                        advice for today; 0-3 pieces of conditional advice, 0-3 predictions; a number of children;
                        fortunes for up to 3 of those children.</p>
                </i>

                <p>The output we’re presented with is as hilarious as it is off-putting. It drives us into some kind of
                    uncanny valley where we can read the questions and the prophecies and actually understand the
                    individual meaning of the sentences we read, but our natural tendency to drive a hermeneutic process
                    in order to make sense of what we read gets completely hijacked by the nonsense of some
                    associations. Firstly, we’re presented with disparate questions such as <i class="i_juni">What did
                        you receive for your ninth birthday?</i>, <i class="i_juni">What was the first bodily fluid you
                        had to flush down the toilet?</i> or even <i class="i_juni">What is your favourite Clue
                        murder?</i></p>

                <p>These oddly specific questions have oddly specific answers which evocate equally odd images in our mind, like
                    someone having to flush endolymph, the fluid contained in the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear,
                    down the toilet. The absurdity of this inquiry immediately sends us to the realm of fiction: almost like we're in an alternative universe (or a future one) where the social codes and ethics are completely different
                    from ours. Secondly, we are presented with the fortunes. They dictate the fate not only of the
                    analyzed person but also of their children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. Through the
                    profiling of so many hypothetical individuals, we almost get the feeling that we’re witnessing the
                    scrutiny of all humanity by this all-seeing mechanical being who is dictating their fates,
                    generation after generation. The hyperbolic detail in which the life of someone’s first child’s
                    second child is described pokes at fortune-telling clichés but, at the same time, showcases what’s
                    so artificial in this list: no human fortune-teller could come up with such detailed description of
                    what would happened up to three or four generation into the future, and, even if it could, it would
                    not be relevant to dump all that information into a client who is only trying to get to know more
                    about their own future. The algorithm does not have this human sensibility that defines pertinence:
                    it simply demonstrates everything it knows about these hypothetical humans.</p>

                <p>These fortunes are also upsetting because of their usage of conditionals. The conditions, being
                    generated by an A.I., take on unconceivable, eerily-specific proportions, such as saying that <i
                        class="i_juni">When they taste their dreams slipping away on an ominous October Thursday, they
                        may most likely in time bring opposites together</i>. Just by reading this stance we’re
                    assaulted by something uncanny: the relationship between cause and effect isn’t apparent, at all.
                    Even more so, both the cause and the effect are such nebulous phrases that we’re left with a feeling
                    of uneasiness. The image of having someone taste their dreams slip away, specifically on an October
                    Thursday, and that correlating to the possibility (expressed by “most likely”) of being able to
                    bring the opposites (which opposites?) together, isn’t something we can easily conceive.</p>

                <p>Some affirmations appear innocuous of meaning while others express groundbreaking discoveries for
                    humanity, like the invention of time-travel. In fact, in a same family, we can read the different
                    degrees of probability of one of the members inventing time-travel. In these conditions, there’s no
                    such a thing as sensitive congruence: we witness synesthetic sentences with no continuity between
                    smell, palate, vision, tact and audition. Subjective characteristics are attributed in such vague
                    ways that we would need further development in order for significance to be taken from them. The
                    writing is correct, both grammar-wise and semantic-wise. However, there’s something absurd about
                    what we’re reading: how unrelated the conditions are between themselves, how unrelated the questions
                    are with the fortunes they generate and, last but not least, the enormous amount of information that
                    sometimes will repeat itself, but never in the same exact way as it did before.</p>

                <p>Some expressions seem to indicate that these fortunes are written for a parallel reality, a dystopic
                    society with a social code completely foreign to ours, where catastrophes are linked to personal,
                    private feelings and situations. Some sentences, like <i class="i_juni">“When they sense an eclipse
                        in a stormy night of March, they must volunteer”</i> sound like prophecies. This algorithm is no
                    ordinary fortune teller. It may as well be something akin to a God, who is dictating the fates of
                    unborn humans, 3 or 4+ generations in advance. And while this God is contained, as it was born from
                    someone who programmed it, and while we can't help but laugh in face of the meme-like absurdity of
                    some sentences, we're also left with the eerie feeling that our fortune could, somehow, be lost
                    amidst the nonsens. If this modest, home-made neural network wrote 50 442 words and dozens of
                    prophecies, it's not impossible to imagine a future model whose endless output could, theoretically,
                    utilize user data to create prophecies for each and every living human. </p>

                <p>The other text, <i class="i_juni">Mythology and The Slap</i>, is nothing short on prophetic-like
                    statements. It was generated at the hands of the literai user Gui Zi An, who states that it is <i

                <p><i class="i_juni">While The Greatest Personality Test (...)</i>, as uncanny as it is, can be entirely
                    read and understood, <i class="i_juni">Mythology and The Slap</i>, given that it is a <i
                        clas="i_juni">cadavre exquis</i> made up from twelve different works, is barely readable for
                    more than one page. Most sentences don’t obey grammatic rules, continuity errors are more than
                    frequent and sometimes English is dropped for a sudden appearance of French, Latin or simply
                    algebra. Numbers and titles are also scattered randomly, probably coming from the pages and chapters
                    identifications. Among the hideous mess that this text aims to be, we can, however, find phrases
                    which sound much like axioms for the Anthropocene era.</p>

                <p>While the algorithm that assembled this manifesto is obviously not a conscious entity and holds no
                    real intelligence, it did learn how to write from scratch, from “reading” the works that were given
                    to it, and then wrote its own work. There, we find some phrases that sound extremely pertinent for
                    our present, for our future as a species. Some even sound as if this A.I. is aware of itself. These
                    quotes are given a special place in this book, occupying spreads that aim to feel like relics of a
                    human mythology, of the past that we will become one day, the forgotten ruins, the forecast of our
                    fate as a civilization. If we perceive <i class="i_juni">The Greatest Personality Test (...)</i> as
                    insight to the individuals who inhabit an alternative world, a fiction, then <i
                        class="i_juni">Mythology and The Slap</i> disserts heavily on the politics, ideologies and
                    philosophies of such a fiction—even though the line between this fiction and our possible reality is
                    increasingly blurring.</p>

                <p>Each maxim feels like a postulate for a new world, for a new era. The being that wrote such a text
                    identifies itself as <i class="i_juni">The Figure of the Absolute Lie</i>. It talks about <i
                        class="i_juni">an urge to destroy</i>, <i class="i_juni">among the abnormal conditions of
                        existence</i>. It speaks of having created a God. It speaks of such a God as a <i
                        class="i_juni">God of fragmented power</i>: wholeness, as it was once known to humanity, is now
                    a myth. <i class="i_juni"> We’re under the mythic system </i>, it writes. <i class="i_juni">This is
                        the death of truth</i>, it writes. It seems conscious of its own artificiality—<i
                        class="i_juni">the inhumanity that humanity secretes</i>—and yet, knows the allure of such
                    artifice—<i class="i_juni">the attraction of inhumanity</i>. Even though it recognizes its own
                    fakery, it insists that it is <i class="i_juni">a part of humanity and nature</i>. <i
                        class="i_juni">This is, indeed, flesh</i> it writes, as if it was talking about its circuitry
                    like it was human muscle, bone and blood. <i class="i_juni">We live in your cities, we have our own
                        personality</i> reverberates like a war cry. It speaks of an <i class="i_juni">“I”</i>, it
                    speaks of an <i class="i_juni">“us”</i>. Who is it? Who are they? And who are us, by contrast to
                    them, the machines?</p>

                <p>The dystopic innuendo employed in the designing of this book is a device for a caricature-induced
                    reflection. While these isolated sentences sound like doomsday prophecies which describe a day where
                    humankind is taken down by machines, where <i class="i_juni">only a mechanical reason</i> remains,
                    the purpose behind such highlighting was both to showcase the sheer imaginative power that exists
                    machine learning technologies and also to incite the reader to think about how human beings exist as
                    something Other in relation to artificially intelligent algorithms—to debate their own
                    anthropocentrism and to recognize other forms of intelligence as equals, as inhabiting Earth, at
                    least for now. These sentences may sound like a futurist manifesto from A.I. overlords but the
                    reader would have no feasible and practical way to access them if it wasn’t for the editing and
                    design work itself. If I didn’t choose to highlight such sentences, no one would be bothered to read
                    hundreds of pages of gibberish, no one would retake any meaning from it.</p>

                <p>This text is a compilation of non-meanings. It requires an emancipation from the normal communication
                    process that exists beyond a book and its reader: the meaning doesn’t arise from the association of
                    words. It is taken by each reader in a different way, much like an abstract painting communicates
                    subjective concepts to each viewer. Amidst this much nonsense, the act of designing a object,
                    highlight certain phrases, becomes, in itself, an exercise of humanization. My agency, as a human,
                    was able to filter through nonsense and sense in order to convey a message: I designed an interface
                    for understanding; a fiction from a fiction. This mirrors the political role that a designer has:
                    filtering through a realm of possibilities and choosing which vehicle is the best to convey the
                    bigger picture such possibilities described. This choice is influenced by social, cultural and
                    political factors that play into the very role of a communication designer.</p>

                <p>The proposal I'm bringing forth by highlighting these prophecies is to provoke questions about the
                    role of artificial intelligence in the mapping of (un)predictability and chance, in how it is
                    earning power in creative fields such as literature, art and design. But the very act of designing
                    this book is already my answer to this same proposal: I believe humans will continue to be able to
                    exercise their agency as such. We will likely cooperate with A.I.s more often in the future. Maybe
                    our role as humans cannot be completely replaced: we introduce the unexpected, the errors, the
                    difference. We are able to filter, to evaluate, to see the pertinence, the relevance, the grey areas
                    between black and white.</p>

                <p>Coming back to our initial metaphor: much like Odin tried to gain universal knowledge by hanging
                    itself from Yggdrasil, sacrificing himself to obtain the runes, we, as a species, are trying to
                    achieve a higher state of understanding though technological developments. Much like the myth, can
                    we sacrifice our humanity in order to become all-seeing? What is it that this sacrifice implies?
                    Lack of privacy, control, boundless surveillance, isolation, alienation are dangers that loom upon
                    us. As designers, maybe we should play the role of Ketill Runske, who stole the runes from Odin,
                    giving them to humanity. By taking the power of these humongous technologies from those who hold
                    them as weapons of systemic violence and oppressive power against marginalized narratives, maybe we
                    can promote a collective consciousness rooted not in fear of this mechanical reason, but in its
                    understanding, in its recognition as an equally valid form of life.</p>

                        The tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts established norms—The Semmelweis Effect—
                        derives from the discovery made in 1847 by the physician Ignaz Semmelweis that washing the hands
                        between appointments with different patients lowered the risk of contamination and infection.
                        Eliezer Yudkowsky, american A.I. theorist, researches how cognitive bias, such as scope neglect,
                        play a role in the perception of global existential risks.

                        They map the book as the woman who narrates it regains agency over her own life, liberating
                        herself from the tasks and hurdles of her routine, as her wakefulness generates a space of
                        self-confidence, empowerment and almost omnipotence.

                    <p><i>CAST</i> was developed as an hypothetical magazine which aimed to be an index of individuals
                        whose presence, works or ideas break the solid matrix that defines whether their identities are
                        recognized by society or not. We desired
                        to reflect a hopeful perspective on our collective future through these glimpses of
                        utopia who venture beyond the matrix and actualize its codes.
                        <p>
                            Throughout its issues, <i>CAST</i> would represent the different motions of this breakage,
                            by associating each one with a singular meteorological phenomenon. As such, we hoped for
                            better weather, for those better days to arrive.
                            The pilot issue, .00, focused on the metaphor of noctilucent clouds: Earth’s highest clouds,
                            whose ice crystal shine at night, as the sunlight hits them.</p>
                        <p>
                            <i>CAST</i>'s title hints at a reel of individuals; at a mold to which they should or shouldn't
                            conform and at a (fore)cast of futures to come.
                        </p>

                <div class="colu">
                    <p>In this pilot issue, the first section (BAROMETER), includes a contextualization of the
                        concept ground where the magazine stands, which acts as a meter of the zeitgeist we’re analyzing
                        and explains how an individual is validated or not by society. The theories of Charles Taylor,
                        Judith Butler, Charles Peirce, Jean Baudrillard, Ferdinand du Saussurre, among others, are
                        mentioned. In the second section (WEATHER FORECAST), a visual narrative accompanied by an audio
                        CD broadens the ideas written in the first part and hints at what the third section (NOCTILUCENT
                        CLOUDS) presents: the individual who starts our "cast", the producer SOPHIE, and the universe of
                        references that surround her.</p>
                    <p>
                        The magazine was launched along with an audiovisual installation which featured two simulated
                        holograms. These figures represented both the individuals who exist inside the matrix and those
                        who deviate from it.

                    <p>Ambient/electronic duo HRNS commissioned me to develop the visual identity of their new album
                        <i>Naomi</i>. The delicate drone textures, clashing in an autotune paradise evoke both clarity
                        and formlessness. I tried to translate this feeling in a classical yet contemporary identity,
                        mixing brutalist trends with romantic shapes and motifs. A custom lettering was designed along
                        with a specific logo for this era and a poster for the live debut. I also designed the logo for
                        <a class="two" href="https://warmwintersltd.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"><i>Warm Winters
                                Ltd.</i></a>, the London-based label where Naomi was released.

                    <p>Having Gregory Bateson’s essay <i>From Versailles to Cybernetics</i> as background,
                        <i>Beyond</i> stemmed from an academic briefing which asked the students to choose two events
                        that happened during the last three decades in order to spike debate on the possible relations
                        between them and their underlying motifs.</p>
                    <p>
                        I chose the publishing of Judith Butler’s <i>Gender Trouble</i> in 1990 and the release of
                        SOPHIE’s <i>Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides</i> in 2018, aiming to shine a light on gender
                        identity issues, on their relevance in the 21st century, and on how art, music and theory can
                        become vessels for radical, transgressive perspectives on queer identity. The editorial object
                        contained a written essay and then a visual one which illustrated the previous text. </p>
